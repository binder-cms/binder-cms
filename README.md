Binder CMS
==========

A content management system for coders.

What is Binder?
---------------

Binder is a content management system (CMS) to help you build a website.

Who is this for?
----------------

Binder is for people who want to:

* code HTML and CSS by hand;
* build a website using their preferred text editor or IDE;
* maintain their website in their preferred version control system
  (eg, [Git][git]).

If you do not know how to write HTML by hand, then this is not for you. You
probably want a more "traditional" CMS such as [Wordpress][wordpress].

[git]: https://git-scm.com
[wordpress]: https://wordpress.org

Why another content management system?
--------------------------------------

If you match the target audience described above, then you might already
know why a traditional CMS is not for you.
